# phoenix.ai

Phoenix enables you to get to MLOps insights at lightning speed. Unlike other observability tools, phoenix focuses on surfacing areas of critical attention relating to your model's features and predictions. Phoenix offers zero-config observability for model drift, performance, and data quality.

**_ NOTE: Phoenix is under active development. APIs may change at any time _**

## Getting started

```shell
pip install phoenix
```

## Unstructured data

Phoenix takes advantage of UMAP and HDBSCAN to highlight segments of your data that are areas of critical drift.

## Structured / tabular data

Coming Soon
