# Define Your Schema

This section show you how to define your model schema with concrete examples.

## Predictions and Ground Truth

Let's first see how to define a schema with predictions and ground truth. This example DataFrame contains inference data from a binary classification model that predicts whether a user clicked on an advertisement, including the scores output from the model. The timestamps represent the time at which the inference was made in production.

### DataFrame

| timestamp           | prediction | target    | score | target\_score |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----- | ------------- |
| 2023-03-01 02:02:19 | click      | click     | 0.91  | 1.0           |
| 2023-02-17 23:45:48 | no\_click  | no\_click | 0.37  | 0.0           |
| 2023-01-30 15:30:03 | click      | no\_click | 0.54  | 0.0           |
| 2023-02-03 19:56:09 | click      | click     | 0.74  | 1.0           |
| 2023-02-24 04:23:43 | no\_click  | click     | 0.37  | 1.0           |

### Schema

```python
schema = px.Schema(
    timestamp_column_name="timestamp",
    prediction_label_column_name="prediction",
    actual_label_column_name="target",
    prediction_score_column_name="score",
    actual_score_column_name="target_score",
)
```

## Features and Tags

### Implicit and Excluded Features

Sometimes, you have a large number of features and it is inconvenient to list them all.
