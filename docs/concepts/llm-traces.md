description: Tracing the execution of LLM application

# Overview: Tracing

Tracing is a powerful tool for understanding how your LLM application works. Phoenix has best-class tracing capabilities and is not tied to any LLM vendor or framework.

Tracing can help you track down issues like:

* An unexpected end result such as a hallucination
* Why certain calls are slower than expected
* How many tokens is my application using at each step
